Why did you do this to me? It’s so unfair!  
I can’t believe you lied to me again!  
I’m so frustrated with this situation!  

That smell is absolutely revolting.  
This food tastes disgusting!  
How can anyone live in such filth?  

I’m scared of what might happen next.  
What was that noise in the dark?  
I’m terrified of losing everything.  

I finally got the job I wanted!  
I can't stop smiling today.  
Life feels so beautiful right now.  

I’m overjoyed to see you again!  
This music makes me feel alive.  
I can’t wait to share this good news!  

I’ll get back to you on that later.  
It’s an average day, nothing special.  
I have no strong feelings about this.  

I feel like I’ve lost everything.  
Why does it hurt so much?  
Life feels so empty right now.  

It’s hard to get out of bed today.  
I feel like crying all the time.  
I miss the way things used to be.  

I can’t believe I let everyone down.  
I wish I could disappear right now.  
I’m ashamed of how I acted.  

I wasn’t expecting that at all!  
Wow, this is such a pleasant surprise!  
What a shocking turn of events!
